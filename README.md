Qt and Ruby-based Local Music Explorer
====================

Qt-based Ruby GUI App which scans folders for MP3 Albums and lets you manage your music collection in one way or the other. 
What started out as a simple way of adding last.fm Metadata such as Tags for a given Artist blossomed out into a more general vision of a "Music Explorer". Have some further ideas for this project and will try to update when the time comes.
